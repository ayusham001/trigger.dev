Create a blank project by creating a new Express application:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

Trigger.dev works with Express applications.

</Accordion>

## Installing Required Packages

To begin, install the necessary packages in your Express project directory:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm

npm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/express

```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/express

```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/express

```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>Ensure that you execute this command within an Express project.</Note>

## Obtaining the Development API Key

To locate your development API key, login to the [Trigger.dev
dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev) and select the Project you want to
connect to. Then click on the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu.
You can copy your development API Key from the field at the top of this page.
(Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).

## Adding Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and include your Trigger API key and URL like this:

```bash

TRIGGER_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE
TRIGGER_API_URL=https://cloud.trigger.dev

```

Replace `ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.

## Configuring the Trigger Client

To set up the Trigger Client for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Create Configuration File:**

   In your project directory, create a configuration file named `trigger.ts` or `trigger.js`, depending on whether your project uses TypeScript (`.ts`) or JavaScript (`.js`).

2. **Add Configuration Code:**

   Open the configuration file you created and add the following code:

   ```typescript
   // trigger.ts (for TypeScript) or trigger.js (for JavaScript)

    import { TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

    export const client = new TriggerClient({
    id: "my-app",
    apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
    apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
    });

   ```

   Replace **"my-app"** with an appropriate identifier for your project. The **apiKey** and **apiUrl** are obtained from the environment variables you set earlier.


By following these steps, you'll configure the Trigger Client to work with your Express project.

## Creating the API Route

To establish an API route for interacting with Trigger.dev, follow these steps:

1. Create a new route file (e.g., `route.js`) in your Express project.

2. Add the following code to your route file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { createExpressServer } = require('@trigger.dev/express');
const { client } = require('./trigger'); // Update the path as per your project structure

const router = express.Router();
const { POST } = createExpressServer(client);

router.post('/trigger', POST);

module.exports = router;
```

Make sure to update the path in the `require('./trigger')` statement to match the location of your Trigger Client configuration file.

## Creating the Example Job

1. Create a folder named `Jobs` alongside your Express project files.
2. Inside the `Jobs` folder, add two files named `example.js` and `index.js`.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript example.(ts/js)
const { eventTrigger } = require('@trigger.dev/sdk');
const { client } = require('./trigger'); // Update the path as per your project structure

// Your first job
client.defineJob({
  id: 'example-job',
  name: 'Example Job',
  version: '0.0.1',
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: 'example.event',
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info('Hello world!', { payload });

    return {
      message: 'Hello world!',
    };
  },
});

```

```typescript index.ts/index.(ts/js)
// import all your job files here

module.exports = require('./example');
```

</CodeGroup>

## Adding Configuration to `package.json`

Inside the `package.json` file, add the following configuration under the root object:


```json
"trigger.dev": {
  "endpointId": "my-app"
}
```

Your `package.json` file might look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "trigger.dev": {
    "endpointId": "my-app"
  }
}
```

Replace **"my-app"** with the appropriate identifier you used during the step for creating the Trigger Client.

## Next Steps

Start your Express project, and your Trigger.dev integration should work seamlessly

In your project directory, run
    
```bash
node route.js
```

This command starts your Express server and enables the Trigger.dev integration

<Warning>
  Ensure your Express server is running locally before continuing. You must also leave this server
  running while you develop.
</Warning>

In a **new terminal window or tab**, you can run Trigger.dev locally:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
   You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on port 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end.
</Note>
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the hostname if you're not running on localhost by adding
  `--hostname <host>`. Example, in case your Express server is running on 0.0.0.0: `--hostname 0.0.0.0`.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If your existing Express project utilizes middleware and you encounter any issues, such as
  potential conflicts with Trigger.dev, it's recommended to refer to the troubleshooting guide at
  [Middleware](/documentation/guides/platforms/express#middleware) for assistance. This guide can
  help you address any concerns related to middleware conflicts and ensure the smooth functioning of
  your project with Trigger.dev.
